Bubblegum
=========

This is a project that I put together back in college for one of my early CIS classes.
This was back before the css `border-radius` property even existed; the big deal was that it had rounded corners without images!

See it live at http://nfriedly.github.io/bubblegum/ and http://nfriedly.github.io/bubblegum/template.htm

Use
---

Download the template from https://github.com/nfriedly/bubblegum/archive/gh-pages.zip

You'll mainly want to use `template.htm` and `styles/bubblegum.css` however some of the images and other files may be useful.


History
